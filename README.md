This repository contains an [Nx](https://nx.dev) workspace provisioned for developing NestJS services. The primary application lives in `apps/api` and was generated with the official Nx Nest preset.

## Useful commands

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Create a production bundle:

```sh
npm run build
```

Execute unit tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

Lint the project:

```sh
npm run lint
```

For additional Nx capabilities—such as generating new applications or libraries—refer to the [Nx NestJS documentation](https://nx.dev/docs/technologies/node/nest/introduction).
